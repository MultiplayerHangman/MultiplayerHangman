## Initial Todo

*Client*

- [ ] Canvas for drawing the hangman
- [ ] Guess list: the phrase with underlines with letters filled in and the list of letters guessed
- [ ] Buttons for requesting to be the guesser or the chooser
- [ ] Button for resetting the game
- [ ] Way to enter the name of the player
- [ ] List of events that happened
- [ ] Way to enter a letter for a guess
- [ ] Design and layout the views

*Server*

- [ ] Logic for playing the game - construct with phrase and have a way to `guess` with a letter and find out if the letter was in the phrase, if it was a repeat, or if it's not in the phrase. There also needs to be a way to get the updated phrase returned to the client after the guess, as well as a way to know if the game has ended.
- [ ] Set guesser and phrase provider
- [ ] Set names for players
- [ ] Way to differentiate between players after getting WebSocket request
- [ ] Reset the game

*Other*

- [ ] Setup websocket connection between client and server
